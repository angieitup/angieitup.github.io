<div class="explanation">
    This is a fan-made page deicated to the the Yu-Gi-Oh monster "Number 39: Utopia" (or in the japanese version "Number 39: King of Wishes, Hope")<br><br>
    This website is specifically made to be an archieve of all of Utopia's forms that were shown in the anime (might update to include post era support and manga support in the future)

    <h1>Why?</h1>

<br><br>

    <div class="why-indeed">
        I been a huge fan of Yu-gi-oh for most of my life, Yu-Gi-Oh Zexal, the series where Utopia debuts, is my number 1 favorite from the franchise.<br><br>
        I wanted to show my love for this show via a collection of sorts, and I thought a archieve of Utopia and his evolutions was the perfect idea for it.<br><br>
        If you're a fan of Zexal too, a fan of the franchise, or have never even been into Yu-Gi-Oh, I hope you find something neat in this little website of mine, made with love and years long hyperfixation on a show <3
